					<h2>HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABE!!</h2>
					<p>
						Soooooooo you know your birthday is not complete without
						me sending a paragraph. Happiest birthday to you babe. I
						love you sooo much and don't know what I'll do without
						you.
					</p>
					<p>
						From your last birthday to this birthday, you have been
						through milestones and I am very very happy to have been
						with you through all of those moments. You got to pursue
						a career you enjoy, you got an admit and joined ASU, you
						got amazing roommates, we got to go on dates, we drank
						together, we lived together for some days (more in the
						future), you met my friends and you visited me by
						surprise in LA!!!! You have been with me through my best
						and worst and have supported me with everything. I know
						I can count on you for anything and I can come to you
						with any of my problems and you will be there with me.
						Thank you babe. You know you're special when I literally
						sit down and make an entire website and type out a huge
						paragraph without using ChatGPT. I know that my design
						choices for this website are questionable, and that's
						the proof that you complete me.
					</p>
					<p>
						To think that you have been in this world for 23 years
						and in my life for 5 years makes me sooo happy. I
						literally have been there like 20% (21.74%) of your life
						and that makes me feel soo special. Thank you for being
						with me for 5 years and from next year we'll celebrate
						all your birthdays together.
					</p>
					<p>
						I love you loaaaaaaads and hope you have an amazing
						birthday.
